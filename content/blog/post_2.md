title: Some fundamental selected Wordpress plugins 
best: false
---
Usually, as a freelancer, i have to deal with costumers that require a dynamic  medium-to complex website with a simple CMS to be able to manage it. 
Atop that, all the website need near zero maintenance and the goal is to host it on a managed solution that i can forget off without the need to fix everything with every unstable update or customer mess.

Here comes Wordpress that is the de-facto standard CMS for this type of situations, and its magical world of plugins. I know it's not the best safe and secure solution, but a middle ground between usability and safety is necessary.

Note that this plugins might be not the best in the field, but i seek stability and effectivity as principle.
It's important for me to take into consideration that my needs are straightforward and very simple, as the explanations i have to give to my costumers on why i need those and how they act on the website.

Sometimes it's very hard to try explain basic security implementations and additional layers of security to the "not so tech-savvy" Wordpress final users. 
That's why i decided to make this list. And for consulting it myself when working on of course.

So here are some base Wordpress plugins that i use on the websites that i build for my costumers.
