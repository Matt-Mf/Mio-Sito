Finally Google added this flag to enable chrome displaying the full address. It was a little awkward working in the field of web development and rely on truncated urls and protocols.

In order to show the full URL in the address bar with Chrome, you need to be at least version 83 or higher.

-------------

1. Enable chrome://flags/#omnibox-context-menu-show-full-urls

2. Right click the address bar

3. Select 'Always show full URLs'

4. Done. Full address baby! (https://www....)
