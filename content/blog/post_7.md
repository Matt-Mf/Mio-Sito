title: Mozilla analytics domain list and curious findings
best: false
---

I was compiling a domain list to feed it into my Pihole to block dns queries to Mozilla analytics and telemetry servers, and from a list of Mozilla owned domains, i found some little old treasures. 

```
https://wiki.mozilla.org/Websites/Domain_List/Mozilla_Owned

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Websites/Domain_List/http
```
The list, debloated from abandoned domain, is available on my Github and i will test it to see if it doesn't block any critical function like updates or bug reporting.
**Use at your own risk!**


So, first finding is this old japanese site built to promote Firefox in Japan together with a cute fox mascot, Foxkeh.
Latest post date back to 2009. 
There are also wallpapers and other digital merchandise from that time.

Then there is this strange domain named interforest dot org that seems to be abandoned and for sale. 
Who knows what will have been used for by Mozilla.
A lot of results from Google refer to something about old versions of Windows Server.
Probably it was a testing purpose domain. Who knows...

mecha-mozilla dot org is another strange one. Also this domain is for sale, 
It might be an iot project from a brief review of the project with the same name on Github. 
Some Javascript and Arduino code...

```

But look at that repos names!

- brainwave.js 
- brainwave-logger
- brainwave-experiment
- MachineLearning.js
- brainwave-analyser

And soo on. Remember this project is from 2013!

All i could think reading a few lines of codes is that this project was probably about using an experimental biometric interface made by NeuroSky Inc. to be able to control something with the brain. Probably a scale model.
Soo cool!

Last but not least another interesing ones:

- xulfr dot org: An old french site that have something to do about first releases of Gecko engine used in Firefox browser.
- artzilla dot org: Experimental and artistic browser software. I have no idea about this one.

Was also listed wearitproudly dot org. Very peculiar. Now it is on sale. It could be a good domain name to resell later.
