title: Mozilla analytics domain list and curious findings
best: false
---

I was compiling a domain list to feed it into my Pihole to block dns queries to Mozilla analytics and telemetry servers. 
Here from a list of Mozilla owned domains i found some little old treasures.

```

https://wiki.mozilla.org/Websites/Domain_List/http
```
The list debloated from abandoned domain is available on my Github and i will test it to see if it doesn't block any critical function like updates or bug reporting.

So first finding is this old japanese site built to promote Firefox in Japan together with a cute mascote, Foxkeh.
Latest post date back to 2009. 
There are also wallapepers and other digital merchandise from that time!

Then there is this strange domain named interforest dot org that seems to be abandoned and for sale. 
Who knows what will have been used for.
A lot of results from Google refer to something about old versions of Windows Server.

mecha-mozilla dot org is another strange one. Also this domain is for sale, 
It might be an iot project from a brief review of the repos. Javascript and Arduino code.

But look at that repos names!

- brainwave.js 
- brainwave-logger
- brainwave-experiment
- MachineLearning.js
- brainwave-analyser

And soo on. Remember this project is from 2013!

All i could think reading a few lines of codes is that this project was probably about using an experimental biometric interface made by NeuroSky Inc. to be able to control something with the brain. Probably a scale model.
Soo cool!

Last but not least another interesing ones:

- xulfr dot org: An old french site that have something to do about first releases of Gecko engine.
- artzilla dot org: Experimental and artistic browser software.

Was also listed wearitproudly dot org. Very peculiar. Now it is on sale. It could be a good deal to resell later.
