I use the blog section like halfway between a notebook and a collection of the discoveries I make. Take everything with a grain of salt (everywhere...) and sometimes here and there you will find me working on some corrections to both new and old posts.

All the opinions expressed are mine and may vary over time, even according to the circumstances and reflections I encounter.
